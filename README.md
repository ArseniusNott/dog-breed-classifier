## Dog Breed Classifier

Second project of Udacity's Deep Learning Nanodegree

### NOTES:

1. I included both HTML and PDF LaTeX versions of the my notebook but LaTeX fails to render correctly the code (truncates long code beyond the right edge of the document). So you probably want to look at report.html
2. I tried to recheck my answers and refactor the code at the time that the workspace is having difficulty to autosave the notebook. Some of my changes are unsaved so if there are inconsistencies, redundancies or grammatical errors that would affect the score of my submission, please point it out to me judiciously.
3. This is MY OWN WORK with basis from the course's notebooks, PyTorch forums and StackOverflow answers which I cited in several parts of my report. If you think that I did something wrong in terms of your rules to plagiarism or anything that is within the honor code rules, kindly let me know.
